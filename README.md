# Vagrant_Docker-LocalDev
## Vagrant to create a Development Environment with Docker Engine + Docker Compose

*_One of the latest, and best, way to create a development environment, one which you can be up and running within less than 20 minutes._*

Here’s how it will work; we’ll have one container for PHP, one container for Nginx, and one container for MySQL. Our configuration will bind them altogether so that, when finished, we can run one command line script to build it, boot it, and view it locally on port 8080.

*In this repo you'll find the Vagrant file and its docker-compose provisioning file.*
